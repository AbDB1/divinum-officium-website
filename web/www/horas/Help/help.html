Click <A HREF="https://github.com/DivinumOfficium/divinum-officium/issues">here</A> for some known problems and deficiences. Your help is greatly appreciated.<BR><BR>
The programlet comes up with the page:<BR><BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="mainpage.png" ALT="main page"></CENTER><BR><BR>
<span class=prm>The fist row</span> shows the day's Office (or that which is selected), 
<span class=prma>the second line</span> (if any) is
the Office which is commemorated, or the Scripture which is read at Matins that day. In the top line, feasts are shown in red; vigils and offices of Our Lady in blue; and that of a feria, simplex or commemoration in black.<BR><BR>
In the next line, the widget after the title allows to reset the <span class=prm>date</span>.
The programlet always comes up with the <SPAN class=prma>current date,</span> but you may 
select a different date by pressing
<UL><LI> <FONT COLOR=BLUE> &darr; </FONT> down arrow for the previous day;
<LI> <FONT COLOR=BLUE> &uarr; </FONT> up arrow for the next day;
<LI> or by typing in a new date.
</UL>
After the change you must press the button next to the widget to obtain the new Office.<BR><BR>
The images in the main table serve only remind the reader that the Office is collected from the
<UL>
<LI>Ordinarium = the frame of the Hours;
<LI>Psalterium = the Psalms, forming the main portion of the Hour;
<LI>Proprium de Tempore	= the days as they are part of the seasons of the Church year;
<LI>Proprium Sanctorum = the feasts of the saints;
<LI>Commune Sanctorum = the common part of the offices for the saints.
</UL>

You may find further details at the
<A HREF=brevitechnical.html>Technical Information</A> or 
<A HREF=rubrics.html>Rubrics</A> pages.<BR><BR>

The eight <span class=prm>buttons</span> in blue show the eight hours of the traditional Divine Office;
you may select one by clicking on the tab. If you recite the hours in sequence
(and your browser allows cookies) then the already-completed hours will be listed 
in the same color as the titles.<BR><BR>

Since you have arrived at this page, you have already used the <span class=prm>Help</span> button from
the bottom. Try now <span class=prm>Options</span> button to get the table:<BR><BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="setup.png" ALT="options"></CENTER><BR><BR>

Check or uncheck the priest box, so you will recite the <I>Dominus vobiscum</I> or the <I>Domine exaudi</I>
as appropriate.<BR>
If you check the <B>Building script</B> box, the program will make a list at the bottom 
how the Office for the hour was composed.<BR>
<B>Language</B> selects the language for the first column.<BR>
<You may select <B>white background</B> for the tables of the individual hours.<BR>
The structure of the <B>colors</B> input is: -relative size  [bold] [italic] foreground color.<BR>
If the starting page image extends far beyond the screen, set <B>screen size</B> to a smaller value.
<BR><BR></FONT>

Click <span class=prma>OK</span> 
to get to the main table again. If your computer allows cookies, this values and the
ones on the bottom row will be saved for the next session.<BR><BR>


Without cookies, you may adjust in the address line one or more of the following parameters:
</FONT><B>
<PRE>
?expand=all&version=Rubrics 1960&lang2=English&priest=1&screenheight=800
</PRE>
</B>
The first parameter has to be started with <B>?</B>; the subsequent ones by <B>&</B>.
After the = sign, any value from the appropriate table could be used.
</FONT><BR><BR>

The widgets on the <span class=prm>bottom row</span> allows you to control how the
collection is shown. Click now on <span class=prma>skeleton</span> and click on
<span class=prm>Completorium</span> button.<BR><BR>

The programlet shows the skeleton of the easiest-to-compose <span class=prm>Hour</span>, that of Compline.<BR><BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="compskel.png" ALT="completorium-skeleton"></CENTER><BR><BR>

Only the <span class=prma>Psalmi</span> and the <span class=prma>Preces</span> 
are changeable, the rest is from the Ordinarium. Other hours are more complex. Click on the 
name of each hour. The comments in black indicate the source of the chapter.<BR><BR>

If you click on any <span class=prma>radio button</span> next to the chapter title,
that part will be expanded. Click an another to change the expanded part, or on the same
chapter's button again, to contract the expansion.<BR><BR>

The picture shows the final <span class=prma>Oratio</span> expanded, and the <span class=prma>Pater Noster</span> as popup.<BR><BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="expandedpopup.png" ALT="expanded and popup"></CENTER><BR><BR>

To <span class=prm>pray</span> the hour, please select any mode other than skeleton:<BR>
<UL>
<LI><span class=prm>all</span> prints everything, including the common prayers. (Default)
<LI><span class=prm>psalms</span> only indicates the common prayers.
<LI><span class=prm>nothing</span> types only the Ordinarium; the psalms, lections and other longer items are only indicated.
</UL>

In the last two cases you may <BR><BR>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="horastable.png" ALT="horastable"></CENTER><BR><BR>

<UL>
<LI>click the button next to the indicated name, and the text will come up in a separate window as a  
<span class=prma>popup</span>.<BR><BR>
<LI>Clicking on <B>Top</B> brings the cell to the top, <B>Next</B> brings the next cell to the top.<BR><BR>
<LI>The number in the right cell is for reference.<BR>
</UL><BR>

Within the text:<BR>
<UL>
<LI><IMG SRC="../cross1.gif" ALT="cross1"> stands for the regular Sign of the Cross (forehead, breast, left, then right shoulder).<BR>
<LI><IMG SRC="../cross2.gif" ALT="cross2"> stands for making a cross with your thumb on your lips.<BR>
<LI><IMG SRC="../cross3.gif" ALT="cross3"> stands for making a cross with your thumb on your breast.<BR>
</LI><BR>
You may also change the date by clicking on <span class=prm>Kalendar</span> tab.<BR> 
Select an other <B>date</B>, by clicking the day of month in the first column. Also you may
change the <B>year</B> <B>month</B> at the top or the version at the borrom of the page.<BR><BR>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="kalendar.png" ALT="kalendar"></CENTER><BR><BR>

Using the widgets you may select the <span class=prma>language</span> for the second column. 
If you select the same language as the first column, only that language will 
be shown, in a single column.<BR><BR>

The last widget on the bottom allows to turn back to the Office of the 
<span class=prma>current day</span> (by clicking "hodie") or to select a 
<span class=prma>votive</span> Office.<BR><BR>

If Divinum Officium has been downloaded to one's computer as a local web host (or via GitHub), it is possible to edit the individual files.<BR><BR>

It is our hope that this programlet will help everyone to understand the Divine Office better,
and help people to start to pray fully (or at least partially) the Breviarium Romanum on a daily basis.
